Hi guys, if you really care about my DIY Weather Station, leave a like (or something idk) and lifespan of the station will be longer!
here is the link to page:
g4m3rpl.github.io/esp32-meteo/


Things i used for the project:
1. Random plastic box
2. ESP32 DEVKIT/DEV MODULE
3. Some wires
4. PowerBank
5. USB-Mini cable
6. ,,Do Not Eat" Silica Gel
7. SOme tape


There will be updates, where there will be new modules.
Thanks!
